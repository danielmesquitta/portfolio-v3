              I’m currently working at Reddit through outsourcing by <a href="https://www.turing.com/" target="__blank" >Turing</a>. I’ve been migrating hot paths from Python to Go, halving latency and boosting efficiency from 11 → 160 requests/core (~15×) for features used by 100M+ daily users. I ship safely with Tap Compare, shadow traffic, and rolling releases monitored in Grafana, and I write design docs to share the how/why.

I used TDD to reach high test coverage and integrated automated code analysis, linting, and reviews into CI/CD to reduce regressions and recurring bugs.

              Atualmente, estou trabalhando no Reddit por meio de outsourcing pela <a href="https://www.turing.com/" target="__blank" >Turing</a>. Tenho migrado hot paths de Python para Go, reduzindo a latência pela metade e aumentando a eficiência de 11 → 160 requisições/core (~15×) para recursos usados por 100M+ usuários diários. Faço deploy com segurança usando Tap Compare, shadow traffic e releases graduais monitoradas no Grafana, e escrevo design docs para compartilhar o como e o porquê.
